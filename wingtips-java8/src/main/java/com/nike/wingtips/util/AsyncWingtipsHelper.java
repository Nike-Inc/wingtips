/**
 * Helper class that provides methods for dealing with async stuff in Wingtips, mainly providing easy ways
 * to support distributed tracing and logger MDC when hopping threads using {@link CompletableFuture}s, {@link
 * Executor}s, etc. There are various {@code *WithTracing(...)} methods for wrapping
 * objects with the same type that knows how to handle tracing and MDC. You can also call the various {@code
 * linkTracingToCurrentThread(...)} and {@code unlinkTracingFromCurrentThread(...)} methods directly if
 * you want to do it manually yourself.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: This is an interface to allow for custom implementations, however if you only ever need the default behavior
 * you can refer to {@link #DEFAULT_IMPL} for static access. There's also {@link AsyncWingtipsHelperStatic} that has
 * static methods with the same method signatures as this class that simply pass through to {@link #DEFAULT_IMPL},
 * allowing you to do static method imports to keep your code more readable at the expense of flexibility if you
 * ever want to use a non-default implementation.
 *
 * <p>Here's an example of making the current thread's tracing and MDC info hop to a thread executed by an {@link Executor}:
 * <pre>
 *   AsyncWingtipsHelper asyncHelper = AsyncWingtipsHelper.DEFAULT_IMPL;
 *   Executor executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
 *
 *   executor.execute(asyncHelper.runnableWithTracing(() -&gt; {
 *       // Code that needs tracing/MDC wrapping goes here
 *   }));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>And here's a similar example using {@link CompletableFuture}:
 * <pre>
 *   AsyncWingtipsHelper asyncHelper = AsyncWingtipsHelper.DEFAULT_IMPL;
 *
 *   CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(asyncHelper.supplierWithTracing(() -&gt; {
 *       // Supplier code that needs tracing/MDC wrapping goes here.
 *       return foo;
 *   }));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This example shows how you might accomplish tasks in an environment where the tracing information is attached
 * to some request context, and you need to temporarily attach the tracing info in order to do something (e.g. log some
 * messages with tracing info automatically added using MDC):
 * <pre>
 *     AsyncWingtipsHelper asyncHelper = AsyncWingtipsHelper.DEFAULT_IMPL;
 *     TracingState tracingInfo = requestContext.getTracingInfo();
 *
 *     asyncHelper.runnableWithTracing(
 *         () -&gt; {
 *             // Code that needs tracing/MDC wrapping goes here
 *         },
 *         tracingInfo
 *     ).run();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>If you want to use the link and unlink methods manually to wrap some chunk of code, the general procedure looks
 * like this:
 * <pre>
 *  AsyncWingtipsHelper asyncHelper = AsyncWingtipsHelper.DEFAULT_IMPL;
 *  TracingState originalThreadInfo = null;
 *  try {
 *      originalThreadInfo = asyncHelper.linkTracingToCurrentThread(...);
 *      // Code that needs tracing/MDC wrapping goes here
 *  }
 *  finally {
 *      asyncHelper.unlinkTracingFromCurrentThread(originalThreadInfo);
 *  }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Following this procedure (either the all-in-one {@code *WithTracing(...)} methods or the manual procedure)
 * guarantees that the code you want wrapped will be wrapped successfully with whatever tracing and MDC info you want,
 * and when it finishes the trace and MDC info will be put back the way it was as if your code never ran.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: If your class only needs one tracing-wrapped type then you can pull in the slightly less verbose static
 * helper methods directly from the class, e.g. {@code RunnableWithTracing.withTracing(...)}, and then your
 * code could be the more compact {@code withTracing(...)} rather than {@code runnableWithTracing(...)}. If you need
 * multiple tracing-wrapped types in the same class then the slightly longer-named methods in this helper class can
 * be used to disambiguate.
 * 
 * <p>WARNING: Be careful with the manual {@code linkTracingToCurrentThread(...)} method to link tracing and MDC.
 * If you fail to guarantee the associated unlink at the end then you risk having traces stomp on each other or having
 * other weird interactions occur that you wouldn't expect or predict. This can mess up your tracing, so before you use
 * the manual linking/unlinking procedure make sure you know what you're doing and test thoroughly in a multi-threaded
 * way under load, and with failure scenarios. For this reason it's recommended that you use the
 * {@code *WithTracing(...)} methods whenever possible instead of manual linking/unlinking.
