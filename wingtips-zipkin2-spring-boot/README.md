# Wingtips - zipkin-spring-boot

Wingtips is a distributed tracing solution for Java based on the 
[Google Dapper paper](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/36356.pdf). 

This module is a plugin extension module of the core Wingtips library and contains support for distributed tracing in a 
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) environment with [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io/) integration.

## Usage Examples

NOTES: 

* The [Wingtips Spring Boot sample project](../samples/sample-spring-boot) shows these features in action.
* The [wingtips-zipkin2](../wingtips-zipkin2) module readme contains more details on the core Wingtips-with-Zipkin
integration features.
* All of the features of the [wingtips-spring](../wingtips-spring) module are relevant to a Spring Boot 
project as well - please see that module's readme for more info on its features.
* More details can be found in the javadocs for the various classes found in this `wingtips-zipkin-spring-boot` module.

### Utilizing `WingtipsWithZipkinSpringBootConfiguration` in a Spring Boot application to configure and setup Wingtips tracing with Zipkin integration

Ensure that the following `@Configuration` gets registered in your Spring Boot app's `ApplicationContext`:

``` java
@Configuration
@Import(WingtipsWithZipkinSpringBootConfiguration.class)
public class MyAppSpringConfig {
}
``` 

And specify configuration from your Spring Boot app's `application.properties` (note that all properties are optional
except `wingtips.zipkin.base-url`, which is required if you want the Zipkin integration to work):

``` ini
# General Wingtips config
wingtips.wingtips-disabled=false
wingtips.user-id-header-keys=userid,altuserid
wingtips.span-logging-format=KEY_VALUE 

# Zipkin integration config for Wingtips
wingtips.zipkin.zipkin-disabled=false
wingtips.zipkin.base-url=http://localhost:9411
wingtips.zipkin.service-name=some-service-name
```

## Feature details

This `wingtips-zipkin-spring-boot` module contains the following features/classes:

* **`WingtipsWithZipkinSpringBootConfiguration`** - A Spring `@Configuration` bean that uses 
`@EnableConfigurationProperties` to pull in `WingtipsZipkinProperties` (described below) and uses those properties to 
set up the following Wingtips-with-Zipkin features:
    - Registers a `WingtipsToZipkinLifecycleListener` with Wingtips' `Tracer` so that Wingtips spans are automatically
    sent to your Zipkin server as they are completed.
    - This class itself does a `@Import(WingtipsSpringBootConfiguration.class)`, so all the config features defined in
    the [wingtips-spring-boot](../wingtips-spring-boot) readme are automatically supported here. The usage example 
    above shows that support via the `wingtips.wingtips-disabled`, `wingtips.user-id-header-keys`, and 
    `wingtips.span-logging-format` properties which are specific to `WingtipsSpringBootConfiguration`. The remaining
    `wingtips.zipkin.*` properties are specific to `WingtipsWithZipkinSpringBootConfiguration`.
* **`WingtipsZipkinProperties`** - The Spring Boot 
[@ConfigurationProperties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-typesafe-configuration-properties) 
companion for `WingtipsWithZipkinSpringBootConfiguration` (described above) that allows you to customize some 
Wingtips-with-Zipkin integration behaviors from your Spring Boot application's properties files. See the 
[Spring Boot sample application's application.properties](../samples/sample-spring-boot/src/main/resources/application.properties) 
for a concrete example. The following properties are supported:
    - **`wingtips.zipkin.zipkin-disabled`** - Disables registering `WingtipsToZipkinLifecycleListener` with Wingtips 
    if and only if this property value is set to true. If false or missing then `WingtipsToZipkinLifecycleListener` 
    will be registered normally (as long as `wingtips.zipkin.base-url` is specified).
    - **`wingtips.zipkin.base-url`** - *(REQUIRED)* The base URL of the Zipkin server to send Wingtips spans to. This 
    is the only property that is required for `WingtipsWithZipkinSpringBootConfiguration` to be able to setup the
    Zipkin integration - if this is missing then `WingtipsToZipkinLifecycleListener` will not be registered. See 
    the [Zipkin quickstart](http://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart) page for info on how to easily setup a local Zipkin 
    server for testing (can be done with a single docker command).
    - **`wingtips.zipkin.service-name`** - The name of this service, used when sending Wingtips spans to Zipkin. See 
    the [wingtips-zipkin2 readme](../wingtips-zipkin2) for details on how this service name is used. If you don't set
    this property then `"unknown"` will be used.

For general Wingtips information please see the [base project README.md](../README.md).
